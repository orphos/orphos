# Mullos
Mullos is an implementation of Orphos Programming Language, written in OCaml.

# Building
1. Install opam.
2. Install opam-lock (`opam install opam-lock`).
3. Create opam local switch by mullos.opam.locked (`opam switch create . --deps-only --locked`).

From μύλλος (Acient Greek "red mullet"), phonologically influenced by ML (because Orphos is a descendant of ML and written in Ocaml).
